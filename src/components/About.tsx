          Hi!<br />
          My name is Jacob, and I'm currently a student at VÃ¤rnamo Campus, orientation Java-development. <br />
          Personally, I consider myself a logical and curious individual, always seeking out fresh and<br /> 
          innovative solutions to problems. I find backend development to be the most challenging and<br />
          enjoyable aspect of my work, and I aspire to further refine my skills in that domain.<br />
          Among my various hobbies, I take pleasure in exercise, golfing, cooking delicious meals and computer games. <br />
          I genuinely hope you find this website intriguing. Should you have any inquiries,<br />
          feel free to reach out to me via my LinkedIn. And dont forget to check out my projects and CV!
