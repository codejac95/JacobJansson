          Hi!<br />
          My name is Jacob, and I'm currently a student at VÃ¤rnamo Campus, orientation Java-development.
          Personally, I consider myself a logical and curious individual, always seeking out fresh and
          innovative solutions to problems. I find backend development to be the most challenging and
          enjoyable aspect of my work, and I aspire to further refine my skills in that domain.
          Among my various hobbies, I take pleasure in exercise, racket sports, golfing and computer games.
          I genuinely hope you find this website intriguing. Should you have any inquiries,
          feel free to reach out to me via my LinkedIn. And dont forget to check out my projects and GitHub!
