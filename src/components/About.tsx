     <p className="about">
        My name is Jacob, and I'm currently a student at VÃ¤rnamo Campus, orientation Java-development.
        Personally, I consider myself a logical and curious individual, always seeking out fresh and innovative solutions to problems. 
        I find backend development to be the most challenging and enjoyable aspect of my work, and I aspire to further refine my skills in that domain.
        Among my various hobbies, I take pleasure in exercise, golfing, cooking delicious meals, and computer games.
        I genuinely hope you find this website intriguing. Should you have any inquiries, feel free to reach out to me via my LinkedIn.
